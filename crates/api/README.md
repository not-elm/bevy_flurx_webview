# bevy_flurx_wry_api

Provides apis for using core process resources from webview.

This crate is part of [`bevy_flurx_wry`](https://github.com/not-elm/bevy_flurx_wry) and does not perform by itself.

At this stage, I only provide the minimum api.
I will prioritize the stability of the core crates, and then provide additional apis.

However, if there is an api you want, feel free to suggest it in an issue.
