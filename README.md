## Purpose

The purpose of this crate is integrate [bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) and [wry](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry) using [bevy_flurx](https://github.com/not-elm/bevy_flurx).

In addition to that, I would like to take advantage of bevy's extensibility and discover bevy's potential to transcend the framework of existing game engines.
